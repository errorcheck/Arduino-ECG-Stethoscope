🫀 Arduino Biorobot + ECG + Arrhythmias (Live Demo) "Cardiobot" (formerly Arduino ECG))

🔴 LED beats like a human heart
📈 Real-time ECG displayed on screen
🎛️ Turn the potentiometer → generates arrhythmias

CardioBot is a low-cost Arduino-based BioBot designed to simulate heart rhythms and basic arrhythmias for educational purposes.
The module reproduces cardiac behavior using LEDs, visual ECG patterns and adjustable parameters, allowing learners to explore physiological concepts through tangible electronic interaction.

The project is intended for adult education in free community workshops, delivered across two groups (8-class and 3-class formats), bridging electronics, biology and computational thinking in an accessible and inclusive way.

All ECG signals generated by CardioBot are synthetic data, created solely for educational, experimental and training purposes. These synthetic signals can be safely recorded, labeled and analyzed without involving real patient data.

This makes the project especially suitable for AI and data-driven learning, enabling:

Introduction to ECG signal interpretation

Synthetic dataset generation and labeling

Machine learning experimentation for arrhythmia detection

Predictive health and HealthTech prototyping without ethical or privacy risks

CardioBot demonstrates how low-cost bio-inspired robotics can serve as a gateway to AI in healthcare, combining hardware, data and human physiology in a responsible and scalable educational framework.
