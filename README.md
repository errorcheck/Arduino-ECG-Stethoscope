🫀 Arduino Biorobot + ECG + Arrhythmias (Live Demo) (Cardiobot)

🔴 LED beats like a human heart
📈 Real-time ECG displayed on screen
🎛️ Turn the potentiometer → generates arrhythmias

This module simulates cardiac rhythm and basic arrhythmias using low-cost components. It is designed for educational and bio-robotic demonstrations, connecting electronics with real physiological behavior in a tangible way.
This module simulates cardiac rhythm and basic arrhythmias using low-cost components for educational and bio-robotic demonstrations.
It also has strong data-driven AI potential, as the generated ECG signals can be logged, labeled, and later used to train, analyze, and test machine learning models for arrhythmia detection and predictive health applications
